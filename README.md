# La cuillere

This was my very first rails app! I wrote it as part of [Le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.com)'s immersive coding program.

Being my first app, it is very simple. It's basically an ultra simplified version of Yelp. It allows you to create a restaurant entry which has a name, an address, a phone nunber and a category. A restaurant has many reviews, so you can write reviews for each restaurant. An index page lets you see a list of all restaurants created. That's it!
